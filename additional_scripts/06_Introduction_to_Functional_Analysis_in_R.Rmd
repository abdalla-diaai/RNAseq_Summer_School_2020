## Gene Set testing

There are many approaches to searching for biological meaning in the results
of differential expression analysis.

Commonly we look to see if the differentially expressed genes tend to relate
to specific pathways or ontological groups of genes.

We will look at two methods of doing this:

* Over Representation Analysis (ORA)

* Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)

## Gene Set testing

Common sources of Gene Sets:

* KEGG pathways

* Gene Ontologies

* Reactome

* MSigDB (GSEA)

* Manually curated gene lists

## Over Representation Analysis - Method

* This method tests whether genes in specific pathway are present in a subset of 
  genes of interest in our data more than expected.

* The genes of interest could be e.g. statistically significant 
  genes or a cluster of genes from hierachical or k-means clustering.
  
* Given the ratio of genes in the pathway to genes not in the pathway, is the
  number of genes in the pathway and in our subset statistically unlikely by 
  chance.

## Over Representation Analysis - Method

Genes in the experiment are split in two ways:
  
* annotated to the pathway or not
* differentially expressed or not
